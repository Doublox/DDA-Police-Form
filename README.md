### Description :

Hello, I took back an old script of PoliceForm for a server but the design did not please them of the blow Me then my friends decided to make a refoundation As its those which do not like the basic policeform will be able to choose! Just to let you know I started working on it yesterday at 8am

We tweaked the html css and even the javascript by changing some variables and adding some elements
I remind you that this script is 90% finished, you have to finish it!

## Also a lot of credit goes to DlaV (Friend) , RickAn (Original Post) & Ademo (Friend)
I worked on it because I had to present it 
But DLAV and Ademo worked on it voluntarily :laughing:

And thanks to RickAn For sharing this resource
